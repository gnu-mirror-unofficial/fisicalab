<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,
     with the SSI statements intact, from
     http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/boilerplate.html?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
-->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
        -->

<!-- If you would like to make sure your page validates with HTML5, that
     would be a good thing.  To do that, change the first line from
     to /server/html5-header.html before trying the validation.  Maybe
     someday we will be able to make /server/header be HTML5.  -->

FisicaLab (can be pronounced as PhysicsLab) is an educational application to solve physics problems. Its main objective is let the user to focus in physics concepts, leaving aside the mathematical details (FisicaLab take care of them). This allows the user to become familiar with the physical concepts without running the risk of getting lost in mathematical details. And so, when the user gain confidence in applying physical concepts, will be better prepared to solve the problems by hand (with pen and paper). The latest release of FisicaLab have the following modules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kinematics of particles 2D.</li>
<li>Circular kinematics of particles 2D.</li>
<li>Static of particles 2D.</li>
<li>Static of rigid bodies 2D.</li>
<li>Dynamics of particles 2D.</li>
<li>Circular dynamics of particles 2D.</li>
<li>Heat, calorimetry, ideal gas and expansion.</li>
</ul>

The static and dynamic problems are entered constructing the free body diagrams of the objects. Although FisicaLab is easy and intuitive, we recommend you read the documentation first. You can access these files in the option menu <em>Info -> Help</em> (or <em>FisicaLab -> Info -> Help</em>). Also, you can get the documentation in PDF format (see below).
