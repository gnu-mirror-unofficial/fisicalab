<!-- This is the template document for GNU web pages.  We use
     server side includes (#include) for common elements, for
     instance, the very first line of the file.  If you're reading
     this in its expanded form, you can retrieve the original source,
     with the SSI statements intact, from
     http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/boilerplate.html?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
-->

<!-- Instructions for adapting this boilerplate to a new project: -->

<!-- 1. In the line above starting "Parent-Version:", remove the
        "$Revision...$" from around the revision number,
        leaving just Parent-Version: and the number. -->

<!-- 2. Replace "baz" with the name of your project.
        You should be able to do this with search and replace;
        making sure that the search is case insensitive and
        that the case of the replacement matches the case
        of the string found. In Emacs, query-replace will do this
        when case-fold-search and case-replace are both non-nil
        and both search and replacement string are given in lower case. -->

<!-- 3. Of course update the actual information according to your project,
        such as mailing lists, project locations, and maintainer name.  -->

<!-- 4. You can use the patch-from-parent script to semi-automate
        merging future changes to the boilerplate with your file:
        http://web.cvs.savannah.gnu.org/viewvc/*checkout*/www/server/standards/patch-from-parent?root=www&content-type=text%2Fplain
        -->

<!-- If you would like to make sure your page validates with HTML5, that
     would be a good thing.  To do that, change the first line from
     to /server/html5-header.html before trying the validation.  Maybe
     someday we will be able to make /server/header be HTML5.  -->

<p>
GNU FisicaLab is an educational application to learning physics. FisicaLab allows 
students focus in physics concepts when solving problems, leaving aside the 
mathematical details. Currently it can solve problems about kinematics of 
particles, statics of particles and rigid bodies, dynamics of particles (all 
these in two dimensions) and some problems of heat and calorimetry. The 
intuitive use of FisicaLab and its extensive documentation, with a lot of 
examples, help the student to familiarize quickly with the application. However, 
the project need your help to add more features. The next release is planned to 
have modules for fluid mechanics and thermodynamics (power cycles), alongside 
features like read/save problems, filtering of factors in contextual menu and 
many others.
</p>

<h3 id="education">Free Software for education</h3>

<img alt="Education"
src="images/en/education.png" 
style="display: block; text-align: center; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" 
width="350" />

<p>
Free software is important for education, to not enchain the students in using 
privative software packages. Using free software, schools and universities save 
money. But, most important, free software gives users the freedom to control 
their own computers. And encourages students to learn and share, they can make 
copies of the software to take home and to share with his friends. Read 
<a href="/education/edu-schools.en.html">Why Schools Should Exclusively Use 
Free Software</a>.
</p>

<p>
With your support, you will help to expand the range of problems to solve in 
FisicaLab, in adding new features, in the availability in more languages and 
in many other things. So help FisicaLab to reach 7k at March 31, to give 
students a chance of get an ethical education with free software.
</p>

<h3 id="paypal">Why PayPal?</h3>

<p>
Living in Guatemala I don't have many options with crowdfunding 
platforms. Some don't allow me participate, others imposes additional charges 
for people that don't live at certain countries. Anyway, at the end, all 
those platforms requires PayPal to transfer the money. Although PayPal don't 
offers the possibility to transfer money to Guatemala and I should use an 
additional service to achieve this.
